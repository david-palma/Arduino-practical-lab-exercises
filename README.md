# Arduino

This repository is meant to provide open source practical lab exercises for embedded controllers using C/C++ and Arduino.

**NOTE**: it is assumed that you have access to a computer with Arduino software installed.

## List of the exercises

Here you can find the solutions to different simple practical lab exercises using an Arduino board.
The source code is well commented and easy to follow, though a minimum knowledge of C/C++ language is recommended.
