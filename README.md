# Arduino

This repository is meant to provide open source resources for educational purposes about practical lab exercises for embedded controllers using C/C++ and Arduino.

**NOTE**: it is assumed that you have access to a computer with a Arduino software installed.

## List of the exercises

Here you can find the solutions to different simple practical lab exercises using Arduino and programming in C/C++.
The source code is well commented and easy to follow, though a minimum knowledge of C/C++ language is recommended.

- [exercise 00](./ex00): turn the built-in led on and off
- [exercise 01](./ex01): turn an external LED on and off
- [exercise 02](./ex02): making use of array to turn a series of LEDs on and off
- [exercise 03](./ex03): measure the temperature using a TMP36 sensor
- [exercise 04](./ex04): send and receive data wirelessly using a Bluetooth module (HC-05)
- [exercise 05](./ex05): control a servo motor's position wirelessly using a Bluetooth module (HC-05)
- [exercise 06](./ex06): Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for comprehensive environmental monitoring
